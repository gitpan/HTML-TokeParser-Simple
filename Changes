Revision history for Perl extension HTML::TokeParser::Easy.

2.0   Sun Jun 1, 2003
      is_tag, is_start_tag, and is_end_tag now can take regexes.
      Added set_attr and delete_attr methods to rewrite tags on the fly
      Converted to Test::More and doubled the number of tests
      Updated POD
      Updated Makefile.PL to list Test::More as a requirement
      Deprecated 'return_text' now carps

1.4   Wed Nov 13, 2002
      Tokens are now blessed into a separate class to prevent people from
      trying to call parser methods on them.  return_text() has been deprecated 
      in favor of as_is().  Tests and POD updated.

      Updated Makefile.PL to list HTML::TokeParser as a requirement (whoops!)

1.3   Fri July 5 13:11:00 2002
      Added is_tag() method and made the leading slash on an end tag optional.
      Updated the POD and and tests.

1.2   Fri Jun 21 08:05:00 2002
      Turns out the the POD had more errors than I though.  There
      are no changes in the code or the tests, but the POD has been
      updated.

1.1   Fri Mar  1 15:52:00 2002
      Finally got off my duff and added support for the get_tag()
      method.  Also overloaded the is_/(start|end)/_tag methods
      to allow testing for the tag and tag type at the same time.
